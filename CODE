# 🎯 This version uses the formula of a straight line (y = mx + c)

# Sample data (Hours vs Scores)
hours_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
scores_list = [35, 45, 50, 55, 65, 70, 75, 85]

# Step 1: Calculate the slope (m) and intercept (c) using Least Squares Method
n = len(hours_list)
sum_x = sum(hours_list)
sum_y = sum(scores_list)
sum_xy = sum([hours_list[i] * scores_list[i] for i in range(n)])
sum_xx = sum([x ** 2 for x in hours_list])

# y = mx + c
m = (n * sum_xy - sum_x * sum_y) / (n * sum_xx - sum_x ** 2)
c = (sum_y - m * sum_x) / n

# Input from user
hours = float(input("Enter number of study hours: "))

# Prediction
predicted_score = m * hours + c
print(f"\n📌 Predicted Score for studying {hours} hours: {predicted_score:.2f}")
